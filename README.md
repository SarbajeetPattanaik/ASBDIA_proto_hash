Developed an Algebraic Signatures-Based Data Integrity Auditing (ASBDIA) protocol that enables cloud users to periodically verify the integrity of data stored with third-party cloud providers.

Implemented a challenge-response mechanism to validate data integrity through cryptographic hash signatures.

Utilized the Crypto++ library for secure hashing and cryptographic operations, ensuring efficient data verification in C++.
